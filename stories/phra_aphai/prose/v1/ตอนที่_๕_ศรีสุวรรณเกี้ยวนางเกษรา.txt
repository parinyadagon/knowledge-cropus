Absolutely! Here's the prose conversion of the poem, aiming for clarity and modern language while retaining the essence of the original:

**Part 5: Srisuwan Courting Nang Getsara**

**1. Nang Getsara's Reflections**

After returning to the palace, the princess, Nang Getsara, couldn't stop thinking about the handsome Brahman she'd seen. As night fell, her longing grew even stronger. She worried about the young Brahman, wondering if he was still waiting or if he had left the garden.

As she walked past the Dok Lamduan tree, she half-smiled, as if inviting someone to speak to her. She wondered why he hadn't spoken to her. Was he a wandering Brahman who observed celibacy, or was he a prince from a faraway land? Was he disguising himself to see her, and what did he truly want? Did he come alone or with servants? Would he stay or leave?

Overwhelmed with longing, she lay down, burying her face in her pillow and sobbing. She didn't feel like dressing up or playing as she usually did. She forgot to eat, bathe, and could only think of him.

**2. The Ladies-in-Waiting Observe**

The four ladies-in-waiting watched from behind a screen, understanding the princess's feelings. They discussed in hushed tones, realizing how deeply she was in love. They felt sorry for her and wondered how they could help her be with the Brahman she desired.

They approached her bed, asking why she was lying down without speaking. They wondered if she had fallen ill from her visit to the garden. They asked if she was in pain or if she had offended the spirit of the Dok Lamduan tree in the garden. They pretended to care for her, trying to console her.

The princess, annoyed, pretended to be bothered by their presence. She asked if she was sick or had angered the spirits of the Dok Lamduan tree. She wondered if they had ever made offerings to the tree.

The ladies-in-waiting smiled and offered to cure her, saying that the mischievous spirits were making her restless. They offered to sing her to sleep to ease her troubled mind. Then, they picked up a krap (a type of percussion instrument) and began to sing a song that spoke to her feelings.

**3. A Song of the Young Brahman**

The song told of a young, handsome Brahman with golden skin, searching far and wide for a beautiful maiden. As night fell, the song wondered where the Brahman would sleep and wondered if he will find a partner. Will he get the princess that he hoped for?

**4. The Princess's Annoyance**

The princess was moved by the song but tried to hide her feelings. She pretended to be annoyed, accusing them of stirring up trouble and implying that they had conspired to bring the Brahman to her in the garden. She asked if they had been bribed by the young Brahman. She threatened to tell her father, the king, about their actions.

**5. The Ladies-in-Waiting Defend Themselves**

The ladies-in-waiting knew the princess's heart and weren't worried. They claimed they brought the Brahman as an offering to the princess. They said that they did not know his background. They begged her not to report them, pleading with her to keep their secret this time.

They said that they would wait until dawn when the palace gates opened and then tell the Brahman off for being disrespectful. They explained that they had only met the young Brahman alone, and they weren't aware if he was a bad person.

**6. The Princess's Curiosity**

The princess, knowing that the young Brahman was pursuing her, pretended to be indifferent. She pretended that she did not notice him, but actually liked the idea of him chasing after her.

She told the ladies-in-waiting to tell the Brahman off if they went to the garden the next day. She warned them that if he didn't listen, she would report them to the king.

**7. The Ladies-in-Waiting's Plea**

The ladies-in-waiting, trying to talk their way out of trouble, claimed that they were only trying to help bring the Brahman to her. They said that the young Brahman was more handsome than the older ones. They asked the princess not to punish the young Brahman, as he had come with good intentions. They asked her to forgive him and let him serve in the palace.

**8. The Princess's Desire**

The princess acted annoyed and scolded them. She ordered them to bring her a book, and she began to read the story of Unarut (a mythical hero) while the ladies-in-waiting surrounded her bed, praising her beautiful voice.

**9. The Prince's Longing**

Meanwhile, the young prince, Srisuwan, couldn't sleep. He looked up at the moon, comparing it to the princess's face. The scent of the Dok Lamduan flowers reminded him of her.

He imagined seeing her shadow and reaching out to her, but he was only embracing a pillar. Frustrated, he wanted to chop the pillar into pieces.

He heard the three Brahmans laughing and felt embarrassed. He tried to act casual, wandering over to the central pavilion and admiring the potted plants. However, he couldn't stop thinking about the princess.

The sound of crickets and cicadas reminded him of her voice. He called out, asking her to come to him.

**10. Srisuwan's Delusion**

The three Brahmans watched him with concern. They tried to comfort him, asking why he wasn't asleep.

Srisuwan, still lost in his delusion, thought he was speaking to the princess. He spoke of their past lives together.

The Brahmans laughed, asking if he had mistaken them for the princess. Srisuwan, realizing his mistake, acted embarrassed and claimed he saw a ghost.

**11. The Brahmans Comfort Srisuwan**

The Brahmans teased him and said that he must be under a ghost's spell. They suggested that he make offerings to the Dok Lamduan tree to bring good fortune.

**12. Srisuwan's Request**

Srisuwan, still confused, asked the Brahmans to help him find the princess, who he believed was hiding in the palace.

**13. The Brahmans' Advice**

The Brahmans tried to reassure him that the princess wasn't there. They told him that he was too focused on the princess. They encouraged him to confide in them about his feelings so they could help him.

**14. Srisuwan's Plea for Help**

Srisuwan, comforted by their words, admitted that he was deeply in love with the princess. He asked them to help him ease the pain of his love.

**15. The Plan to Woo the Princess**

The Brahmans offered to help him win over the princess. They suggested that he write her a love letter that is charming.

The Brahmans asked if Srisuwan knew how to write love poems. They suggested that he write a letter to her, but advised that there were too many females and males to partner up fairly.

**16. A Raffle to Assign Partners**

Srisuwan smiled and agreed to their plan. He suggested a raffle. He plucked petals from a champak flower and wrote the names of the ladies-in-waiting on them.

He then asked the three Brahmans to choose a petal. Vichien picked a petal with the name Jongkonnee, Sanon got Ubbon Ratsamee, and Mora got Prapawadee. Srisuda was left without a partner.

They all laughed and joked about it, and Srisuwan was embarrassed by their teasing.

As the hour grew late, the Brahmans told him to go to sleep. Srisuwan lay down, thinking about how to write a love poem for the princess. By the time he had finished, dawn had arrived.

He eagerly woke up the three Brahmans and took them to the Dok Lamduan tree in the garden, where they planned to meet the ladies-in-waiting.

**17. The Meeting in the Garden**

As dawn broke, the ladies-in-waiting dressed in their finest clothes and left the palace. As they arrived at the garden, they could hear the three Brahmans calling out to them, inviting them to sit in the shade.

**18. Inquiring about the Prince's Health**

The four ladies-in-waiting sat down politely. They asked how the Brahmans were doing. They heard that the young prince had caught a love sickness so they asked about his condition. They also offered that they would try to heal him if the had the right medicine.

**19. Describing his Disease**

The young Brahman looked shy and embarrassed. The ladies-in-waiting urged him to speak. He then explained the symptoms to the ladies-in-waiting, that he had a cold at night and got feverish in the morning. He said that he would die without their help. He begged that they ask the doctor to treat him so that he would not die.

**20. The Plot to Test the Prince**

The four ladies-in-waiting said that it was a pity that he was sick. They claimed to be embarrassed to admit that because of his disease, they are now involved in his troubles. They went on, mentioning that the day before, when the princess came to the garden, she became interested in him. She questioned them and now they are now here talking to him. They questioned if he had a wife or how many wives he had. If he said that he would like to work for the King, the ladies-in-waiting would allow him to work here. If he had anything else that was important, he should rest here before going back.

**21. Prince Answers Questions**

Srisuwan had the intelligence of a genius and acted to answer honestly to the questions. He revealed that he was travelling with his brothers and had no one else. He intended to serve the King's daughter in the best way possible. He mentioned that he tried to give the Princess some flower but that she turned him away. He wished for them to get her to accept him and was very appreciative for their help. He then picked a leaf of a palm tree and wrote his words of love. He then took a Sorrow Flower with thorns so that the message of the letter can get the sadness from him and the thorns for them to remember his painful sorrow. The ladies-in-waiting then accepted the letter.

**22. Additional Requests by Prince**

He asked that they tell the princess that he hoped to be associated with her for a very long time. He mentioned that he was wearing old clothing because that was all he had to wear at the moment. He then asked the ladies-in-waiting to ask the King's daughter to provide him with clothes that she would wear to the garden. With that, he took out a ring with Garuda and a yellow Sapphire. The ladies-in-waiting were amazed by what they saw and took the ring with them.

**23. Departure of Ladies-in-waiting**

The ladies-in-waiting then packed up their betel nut bags and offered to make a donation to the temple so that they could keep their promise. After doing so, they left back for the palace.

**24. Back at the Palace**

Back at the palace with the King's daughter, the ladies-in-waiting provided the flowers, and the news they had heard from the prince. They mentioned that the prince was pleading with them at the Dok Lamduan tree and they questioned him until he was submissive. The prince admitted he desired the King's daughter and nothing else.

They mentioned that if she did not pity the Prince, he would die. They commented on the manners and the characteristics of the man that made them question the origins of the man who they thought was royalty who was interested in serving the King's daughter.

They asked if she would like them to get rid of him. He cried in pain and the ladies-in-waiting offered to take care of him if that was not her intention. With these things, they awaited her intentions.

**25. Testing the Prince**

The King's daughter was listening with some sadness because she was afraid of his suffering. However, she needed to test him out to see if he could solve problems himself. She questioned the ladies-in-waiting, asking about the words of the prince and how sincere he was.

She questioned if he claimed that she was the most beautiful. He mentioned what his language was and the ladies-in-waiting reported that they would like to tell her but they were concerned for her to become angry.

**26. Disguise**

The King's daughter, showing her annoyance, said that they should not be doing what they thought and if she thought anything, she would like to hear it.

She threw the flower that they provided, and the ladies-in-waiting quickly picked it up and did their thing. The ladies-in-waiting mentioned they hid things for her, like how much the prince thought of her and what he wrote to her. The prince was also able to provide them with a small ring with a Diamond as it would become important. The ladies-in-waiting then provided the leaf and ring to the King's Daughter.

**27. Reading the Prince's message**

The King's Daughter then looked at the leaf. She examined the pain the prince expressed by seeing the thorns. She opened up the letter and saw his thoughts that were now very clear. The leaf then contained his full message of what had transpired. He wrote:

I come from a lineage of Kings from the Land of Ratna. I hope to have some sort of relationship with the Queen's daughter. I went through the most dense forests and over great oceans to see her.
I happened upon the beauty of the Queen's Daughter at the Royal garden, so beautiful. She is one of the most beautiful women to ever come here to play. As you returned to the palace, I was left only to see you leave and miss you every day.
In a time of difficulties and hardship, I could be like the rabbit seeking the moon from the mountain. In times of hardship, my heart is only seeing you. I may not be able to get that which I seek. You are the treasure in the mountain. To hope to hug you and know you is one of my greatest wishes.
Thus, I provide to you this letter and ring. The leaf replaces the most precious of gold. If there is something from a previous life that connects the two of us, please let me know. Please do not be kind in your decision.
I give you the kingdom of Romachakranakara. If you are not so kind, I will give it as an offering as kindling for the fire.
I ask the Queen's Daughter to be a bit more compassionate in this letter and answer what my heart intends. And give me some reason not to be so worried.

**28. Reviewing the Prince's message**

The ladies-in-waiting, who were reading the letter together, was very good with his flattering words. All of the three of them made his words very smooth to hear. The King's daughter then asked for an appropriate response back to the prince.

The ladies-in-waiting responded that the King's daughter should respond back accordingly in some way.

She also mentioned that the thorns represented how much the prince was thinking about the princess. She grabbed the ring and examined the yellow sapphire.

The King's Daughter then took the flower and then decided that she would decide how to respond to him. She mentioned that she would respond in an appropriate manner.

**29. Request to Prince**

The four ladies-in-waiting responded and offered that they would provide her with clothing. The King's Daughter had a shy response and asked what the clothing was for. She agreed to make the swap, but asked what she should do with the clothing. She mentioned that the prince should use the clothing as a way to remember her always. She mentioned that if she loved her that she would promise not to provide the clothing to anyone else.

She then removed the expensive clothing she had and replaced it with another dress. She instructed that the ladies-in-waiting hand it to the prince that she hoped that there would be good fortune from this as it could get very windy and cold. She was then shy to have provided her clothing and continued to request what the letter meant.

She then ended up writing a letter of poetry on parchment and included some flowers. The letter was placed in the flower leaves and brought back by the ladies-in-waiting for delivery to the prince.

**30. The Return to the Prince**

As dawn arose with the morning sun, the ladies-in-waiting went to place the delivery. The placed the clothing within a carved box so it was safe and made their way to the royal garden. As the sun rose, they found the prince and quickly went to greet him.

The prince was happy to see them and made the ladies-in-waiting comfortable at the location. He mentioned that it had been a long time and that he was tired and hungry. But the ladies-in-waiting were there to provide joy to the prince.

They were happy to provide him with what the King's daughter had provided him. With this gift, the prince could claim that he was serving the King's daughter. The four ladies then opened the box and provided to the prince what the King's daughter had returned to him. After doing so, they thanked him and prepared to leave.

After this action, the three of the Brahmans took the four of the ladies to tour the garden to see all the flower and plants. They had a great time, while the fourth of the ladies was left alone due to her lack of partnership.
She was a bit annoyed with them all and moved away from the group.

**31. The Unhappy and Bitter Queen's Court**

The brothers noticed that the one of the Queen's Court looked rather bitter as they went through the garden. They teased that they were being jealous. The other three noticed that the fourth was unhappy. They teased about how the fourth one was just bitter due to her lack of a relationship with them. With this, the ladies-in-waiting called her to talk to the brothers about how she could find a partner.

They mentioned to have a good time with all of those that were there and what might be their destiny as a result of it. There was concern that the Queen's Daughter might become unhappy when she heard about it.
However, the last of the Ladies did not take well to it and turned to leave.

**32. Departure from the Gardens**

The Brothers were concerned for her as the final lady turned to leave. They tried to tell her it was only a jest but that their actions were not being well taken. She continued to press on ahead as they followed after her. With great concern, they decided to leave to avoid the attention of the queen.

**33. With the Prince**

The happy brothers then joined the prince, while holding the Queen's cloth, to celebrate his destiny. However, the prince remained unsure about what the Queen's daughter was thinking and desired to know what the contents of the letter was.

**34. The Content of the Queen's Message**

The prince, with a smile, asked which part he should listen to, what poetry or what words. With that, they reviewed what the queen had told him in her response to his request:

In the letter of the request for kindness that you sought, I will treat you well and not badly. I hope that your family will be very happy.
In the land of Ratnamahasawan, there is prosperity of both people and property and much wealth. In this land, women are easily found in droves.
In this land, there is no need to travel far to get. You have insulted the position of the Queen by what you hope. The actions here are something that puts shame to the kingdom. I do not feel the feeling that you want.
I have heard the talk of love and worship with the hope for life. I wish that you are not interested in me and would never love me. What you wrote had too many things that were said with little substance.
If you were to travel back to your kingdom, I would welcome that. You should send a message that you would travel to the King. And so, please be careful what you ask for.
You are trying to hide your intentions that are inappropriate, this is not something that I want to do. Please reveal your true thoughts so that it may be so. As you know and I will not lie to you.

**35. After the Reading of the Content**

The brothers reviewed how smart the Queen had responded and what to do. But, they desired to encourage him to write something to flatter her so that they are happy.

**36. Pondering Questions**

The Prince started and asked why he had included the tree leaves in his letter. She seemed to be suspicious of how the plant's properties were being used.

**37. An Answer is Given**

Mo Ra then provided an answer that he told her of sadness when he asked for the first time. The response, that they would be sad and split up, caused her to write a new response. This answer had to provide her with something that she would agree to.

**38. A New Response?**

The young monarch mentioned that his thoughts were correct with what the old man mentioned. He should try to respond in a better fashion to the letter. As he considered things, the three brothers asked what his request would be.

**39. The Left Out Courtesan**

As the Queen's member, Si Suda, had finally returned to the chamber, they were dealing with some anger and sadness.

In the room, they were thinking of the shame they had gotten. Oh that they did not have a partner and were made fun of by the Queen.
She would have put so much time and money into herself to become beautiful. To this she did not have a partner and was now sad about her place.

She got so angry that she started to throw and ruin things around the room. The frustration with those who have partners and that she was forced to remain out of it all.
With this she ran out to inform the Queen in an attempt to punish those who wronged her.
With much anger, she ran to the Queen to cause a fight.

**40. The Encounter**

The Queen asked in concern about what was going on and where the others were at.
To which, the fourth courtesan mentioned that the other three were all hooking up with those three brothers for their personal needs. The brothers and sisters are out meeting with partners.

As they sat there, she heard that all they were doing was bad for her.

**41. Incredulous!**

The King was shocked and could not believe what was going on and was upset. They tested what was there for her. If things were true, that she would not be able to punish. They had better be ready to support these claims.

**42. Assurance is Given**

Si Suda claimed that they would not lie and that the people were there to meet and to show each other.

They claimed that the three Brothers and 3 Sisters were off playing and doing things that should not be there and if the Queen were to find it, there would be punishment.

**43. Action Must Be Taken**

The King's child heard everything and knew she was seeing everything correctly and was very angry and upset. The action to take against the trespassers must be dealt with.

**44. The Return**

As the three members returned, they went to see the Queen. They saw the look of concern. They were very scared of being punished.
They tried to provide that the brother was the source of everything, with the flowers and with what they were doing.

They continued to explain about what the brother and what had been doing, what they had been asking and what he wanted of them.

**45. Questions**

The King's son listened to her statement and felt sad. In their anger, they forgot that he was there.

Oh what to do and what to tell and how long were they going to do this. This happened three times, and she asked that she must be very lucky.

They asked the brother how he knew about it and what he should say.

**46. The Response**

They responded that what has happened has caused them to not sleep. That they were just thinking about those great hair pieces and those great women. They also added that if they could see them again that they would do a service to the King and rub it into the face of everyone who had problems with the Queen.

They felt and have spoken those three times just to tell the Queen.

**47. Reaction from Si Suda**

The person from before then got very angry and spoke about what they thought they heard with the message they had heard. With their actions and efforts, these were very problematic and this would be the reason this place could be harmed. The brother's actions were so nice.
There were actions here by the other courtesans, for the love and to see how they could be better, for the touch and the way that they see each other.

These were the reasons what was heard here was that this should never be what was heard here.

**48. Argument for the Queen**

Si Suda spoke strongly and mentioned that what was heard was just and was for those actions of the past to harm all of them.
Since the speaker was speaking of such nonsense, it was nothing as those are good and bad.

The others should fight it there, where they should be and was like chickens seeing insects. With what was being told and what should be understood.

**49. Request to be Removed**

Those three were being angry, and wanted to be removed and they sought that they had been given bad advice. This happened so many times and they requested to leave and for those around them.

As they were leaving, Si Suda began to speak up as their heart was speaking back to the people that it all had happened because of them. These actions will be told to the Queen.

**50. Final Statements**

The brothers were causing so much trouble so that the Queen was beginning to not have any pleasure.
These actions were only pushing for all of those things that were going to cause the queen a lot of problems in the short time to come.

**51. Ending**

The Queen was having a bad time thinking about all the problems and started to become more and more concerned about the problems.
She was hoping that all the problems would go away for now.
